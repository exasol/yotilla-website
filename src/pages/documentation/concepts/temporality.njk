    <h1 id="temporality">Temporality</h1>
    <p>Temporality in data warehousing refers to temporal data, which is data that is only valid for a proscribed time on a specified timeline. Temporal data can be defined by timestamps, timelines, and time slices.</p>
    <p>The use of temporality in Yotilla is described in more detail in the relevant section of <a href="#">The Yotilla Workflow</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="container py-4">
    <h2 class="border-bottom">Timestamps</h2>
    <p>A timestamp defines a specific point in time, not a period of time. Two different types of timestamps are used in Yotilla:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><mark>Technical timestamps</mark> are generated by the system. For example: Load time, Inscription time</li>
        <li><mark>Business timestamps</mark> are entered in the source system by the user. For example: Customer birth date, Departure time for a flight, Hiring time for an employee</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="container py-4">
    <h2 class="border-bottom">Timelines and Time Slices</h2>
    <p>A timeline is the axis on which temporal events happen. Timelines can be specified by the source or generated by Yotilla.</p>
    <p>A time slice is a section of a timeline in which the attributes of a specific business object do not change.</p>
    <p>The timelines generated by Yotilla are the only ones that can be trusted.</p>
</div>
